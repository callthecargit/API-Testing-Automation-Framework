# Introduction 
This project is a comprehensive API testing framework built using Karate, an open-source tool that enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing for web services. Leveraging Karate's seamless integration of Cucumber-style syntax with native support for HTTP, JSON, and XML, this framework is implemented in Java, offering a structured and maintainable approach to automate RESTful API validations.

The primary objective of this framework is to ensure end-to-end validation and performance measurement of APIs across all integrated modules of the application ecosystem. By automating the testing pipeline, this project aims to provide:

Consistent verification of API functionality

Early identification of integration issues

Rapid regression testing support

Real-time feedback on API uptime and stability

Performance benchmarking for critical endpoints

This initiative was driven by the need to streamline the QA process for APIs, reduce manual testing efforts, and enable continuous validation in CI/CD pipelines. The framework is scalable, easily maintainable, and supports data-driven and parameterized testing to cover a wide range of use cases.
